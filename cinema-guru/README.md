# <p align='center'>üåü Implement an App with React üåü</p>

# üìù Description

This project consists of a cinema application in which we keep track of our favorite films and establish a list of movies to watch later. The interface was built using the ReactJs knowledge accumulated in previous projects and displays the data of an API.

The application includes features such as adding movies to a list of favorites, creating a list of movies to watch later, and displaying movie details using data retrieved from an API. The backend was configured with Docker, axios was used for HTTP requests, and libraries like Font Awesome were integrated to enrich the user interface.
